# Description:

App created to help the communication between owners of an AirBnB apartment and their cleaners.
It has a calendar where the owner can show the length and the number of guests the apartment will have. He can also create, edit and delete the tasks the cleaner should perform in each room (exchange bedsheets, check damages, clean area, etc).
On the other hand, the cleaner is able to check the calendar and those tasks - but not able to edit them. However, he is able to create, edit and delete reports (for example about damages found, missing equipment, etc.) and the owner is able to see them, but not edit them.

### Technologies:
